I am a first-year Neuroscience PhD student currently rotating with [Robbe Goris](https://gorislab.github.io). I am interested in computational vision, specifially in how the brain processes visual inputs and turns them into predictions. 

Potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:
- Computational vision (e.g., models of the visual system) 
- Computational neuroscience 
- Spiking neural networks
- Reinforcement learning 
- Bayesian approaches (e.g., variational inference)

I have not teamed up with anyone yet.
