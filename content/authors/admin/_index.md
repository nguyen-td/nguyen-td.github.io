# About Me

Hello! I am a first-year Neuroscience PhD student affiliated with the [Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program ](https://neuroscienceinstitute.utexas.edu/PhD%20Program) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), supervised by [Robbe Goris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nR6fesMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am interested in how the visual system processes inputs and turns them into predictions. 

Before I joined the PhD program, I completed my master's in Computational Neuroscience at the [Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/), where I worked with [Stefan Haufe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fVzmgmYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Arnaud Delorme](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wmxh4LkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on computational methods for analyzing linear and nonlinear functional connectivity in EEG time series. Before that, I did my bachelor's in Computer Science & Economics at the [Berlin School of Economics and Law](https://www.hwr-berlin.de/en/), where I worked at [Berliner Wasserbetriebe](https://languages.bwb.de/en/index.php) as part of their dual studies program.
